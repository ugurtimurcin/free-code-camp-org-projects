                        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                            lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                            can
                            be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a
                            core
                            set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                            JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
                            objects; for example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                                browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions
                                allow
                                an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                                mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                                running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an
                                application
                                to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one
                                invocation to
                                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <article class="mt-4">
                        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
                            The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
                            type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
                            basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                            JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                            Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                            supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
                            properties
                            of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                            variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods
                            are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                            Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                            subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive,
                            letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
                            through "z" (lowercase).

                            use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal
                            names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                    <article class="mt-4">
                        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                        </p>
                        <p> With the keyword var. For example,
                        </p>
                        <code>
                                var x = 42.
                            </code>

                        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                        </p>
                        <p> By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                        </p>
                        <code>
                                x = 42.
                            </code>
                        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                            shouldn't use this variant.
                        </p>
                        <p> With the keyword let. For example,
                        </p>
                        <code>
                                let y = 13.
                            </code>
                        <p> WThis syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                            below.
                        </p>

                <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
                    <header>Variable scope</header>
                    <article class="mt-4">
                        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable,
                            because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a
                            variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only
                            within that function.
                        </p>
                        <p> JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a
                            variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the
                            block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x
                            is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
                            this case is an if statement.
                        </p>
                        <code>
                                if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                            </code>

                        <p> This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                        </p>
                        <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                                defined
                            </code>
